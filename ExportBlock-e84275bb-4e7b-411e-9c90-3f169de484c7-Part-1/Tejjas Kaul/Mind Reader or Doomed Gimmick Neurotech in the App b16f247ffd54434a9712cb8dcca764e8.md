**📑** As we all tuned into WWDC earlier this month—eagerly awaiting for *one more thing*—we all knew Apple’s take on AR/VR was inevitable if the leaks were to be trusted. Finally, the mind reading tech was revealed in all its seamless solid aluminum and glass glory. Now let’s take a look at the neuroscience and tech behind it all!

It’s no shocker that advanced telemetry (e.g. electrical activity, eye tracking, heart beats, muscle activity, blood pressure, skin conductance, etc.) can drastically enhance a wearable’s usability and feature-set. Although many of these metrics are employed in a plethora of smart watches, rings, and what not; albeit it’s a little scary at times—such a comprehensive set of metrics is unheard of in the consumer space.

Moreover, many consumer electronics as of late have some aspects of “health” tech. Letting you know when to stand up or put the phone down (but we tend to snooze those notifications anyway). Although certainly helpful, not all products such as the Apple Watch (which itself is in a grey area amongst health professionals) have gone through rigorous testing to prove their outlandish claims. Leaving us with what is often just snake oil strapped onto tech we might not even need—driving sales and fueling this ongoing cynical cycle. If companies continue to abuse pathos and lure us in with “health” focused ads, at what point do we stop to ask yourselves: *is it just marketing through fear?* 

Give this thought provoking yet relatable podcast episode a listen while you think about the role everyday tech plays for our health:

🔬 Regardless, let’s take a glance into the strides being made in the research sector which eventually trickles down onto the tech that rests on our wrists and now heads as well!

Sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and Blood pressure (BP) recordings measures via the [TRM56SP](https://www.adinstruments.com/products/rat-telemeters#product-TRM56SP) telemeter give insightful info into the autonomic control of cardiovascular physiology.

## **👨‍💻/🧙‍♂️ ”The Magic”**

The Vision Pro has a trick up its sleeve: alongside a beefy M2 system on chip, its armed with the all new in-house 5nm R1 processer. Allowing for an otherworldly experience as conventional metrics will be supercharged by AI. Granted on-board machine learning and artificial intelligence have been implemented before in the likes of Apple’s own watch, never has there been such a powerful purpose-built AI focused chip coupled with a desktop class powerhouse in a wearable. Thus, enabling devs to make use of neat tricks to reliably improve the UX (user experience):

> “One of the coolest results involved predicting a user was going to click on something before they actually did. That was a ton of work and something I’m proud of. Your pupil reacts before you click in part because you expect something will happen after you click. So you can create biofeedback with a user’s brain by monitoring their eye behavior and redesigning the UI in real time to create more of this anticipatory pupil response. It’s a crude brain-computer interface via the eyes, but very cool. And I’d take that over invasive brain surgery any day.”

## 💰/🐑 The Apple Sheep Tax

As it is with seemingly every product in Apple’s walled garden, from the $799 Mac Pro wheels to the $20 cleaning cloth, there is a price premium. Naturally it carries through with the latest and greatest in “spatial technology” with the Vision Pro coming at a hefty $3499—or approximately 5832 bananas 🍌. Is it worth it? It’s hard to say as there is truly nothing else like it on the market. 

Regardless it can be an invaluable tool for many professionals: making Monday morning meetings eerily surreal and allowing for multiple monitors anywhere you go (obviously it won’t be as immersive as the commercials lead you to believe). The Vision Pro can even be for those who want the best viewing experience as they dive into Disney’s 73rd rendition of what was once a cult favorite—barred behind a monthly subscription or two. 

Additionally, it is important for early adopters to consider that software support will be scarce at first, but support should (probably) be maintained given Apple’s track record and limited SKUs. Plus, it is important to note that by announcing its release months in advance, devs have time to adapt and assimilate to Vision OS—integral to a game-ready product on release day. Not to mention the fact that by disrupting the market with such an eye-watering price tag, Apple will imprint a lasting silhouette on everyone’s minds. 

## 📚**/🥊 How it Stacks Up**

Mixed-reality headsets have undoubtedly been a thing long before Apple came into the picture. In 1995, Nintendo was in the game with [Virtual Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Boy). Unfortunately it was a buggy mess with limited games which resulted in more headaches than sales—so it was discontinued the following year. Nearly 30 years before that, in 1968, Computer-graphics guru Ivan Sutherland and his student at the University of Utah engineered the “[Sword of Damocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sword_of_Damocles_(virtual_reality))”. Although it was a rudimentary headset, it is considered to be the first in the space as it was capable of drawing and redrawing wireframes in 3D environments. 

Fast forward to the age of monthly subscriptions and TikTok clones, we now have consumer VR headsets ranging from crude cardboard phone attachments to multi-thousand dollar plastic contraptions. As it stands, it’s hard to tell if the Vision Pro will punch above its weight class or just be another attempt from a tech giant at getting it just right. Anyway, it seems that to the average Gen Z and millennial customer, virtual and augmented reality are still gimmicks suited for nerdy games (e.g. Beat Saber, Pokémon GO, etc.) 

Even then, headsets have yet to really tap into the multi-billion dollar gaming market (at least not as much as Zuckerberg would have likely hoped with the acquisition of Oculus for $2 billion and the subsequent release of the Metaverse a.k.a Medicoreverse). Of the some [3 billion gamers](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/number-of-gamers), only [approximately 171 million](https://www.notion.so/288f7513b52d42a681a6f8b7bbae1a4b?pvs=21) (5.7%) have access to VR; and even a smaller fraction use it regularly. That’s why Apple aims to capture a new subset of people by making VR “cool”—which they have done time and time again.

## **🌯** Wrap-Up

All in all, it’s uncertain how things are going to pan out for Apple’s Vision Pro in this shifting space. Will it meet the fate of Google Glass and disappear into the commercial setting? Will it be stuck at the top of holiday wish lists and in the homes of prosumers? Or will it pave the way for a dystopian future where we completely redefine our interactions with computers (and people) as we know it?
