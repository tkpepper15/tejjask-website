**📑** After a shadowing event, I was lucky enough to have a discussion over email with [Liza Chartampila](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elissavetchartampila/), a Ph.D. Student from the Diering Lab @ UNC Chapel Hill, regarding a promising indicator of Alzheimer’s (AD). Here’s how it went…

💡 Note: Hyperexcitability can be defined as the increased likelihood that a neuron will be activated by a certain stimulus.

*This is what I had to say…*

As a high school student, I don't get much sleep and often stay up late, so it was definitely eye-opening to see the metrics that point toward innumerable adverse health effects. Furthermore, I found your [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33484828/) on the antagonist, atropine, and its role with Alzheimer's truly fascinating. From what I could put together, **hyperexcitability seems to be a promising indicator for AD later on**. ****Do you believe then the answer to preventing AD lies not in its genetic and pathological mechanisms, but in the tangled yet intricate mess that are neural networks and brain regions instead**?** Or do you reckon that a combination of therapeutic avenues can help nail down the "pandemic"?

Additionally, I stumbled upon the idea that reversing abnormal neuronal excitability in parts of the brain affected by Aβ deposition, lessens the Aβ load and halts its spread—improving memory and preventing neurodegeneration. All in all, this is extremely exciting for me and I hope to learn more about what truly goes on in our heads, so I can apply that expertise whenever possible!

W*hat Liza had to say…*

## **🖼️** Big-Picture Conclusions

1. Based on research on rodent models of AD, hyperexcitability could be a promising indicator (or biomarker) of the disease. However, to detect that in humans, you would need to do an EEG (electroencephalogram) recording, ideally overnight (since hyperexcitability is mostly observed during sleep in rodents). However, most people don't do overnight EEG recordings during their yearly check-ups. So, it might be hard to use it as an early indicator in practice.
2. Hyperexcitability could be a promising therapeutic target. Can we prevent AD (or ameliorate it) by treating hyperexcitability? **Maybe, but there is no clear way to treat hyperexcitability yet. It does seem promising though.**
    - Identify ways to safely and effectively reduce hyperexcitability
    - Elucidate the contributions of hyperexcitability to AD pathology

## 🤿 Deep Dive

Unfortunately, there is still so much that we do not understand about the development and progression of the disease. AD can be caused by genetic mutations that disrupt the normal production and processing of Aβ (familial). However, the vast majority of AD cases are the result of a combination of genetic and other risk factors (sporadic). That is of course true for most neurological disorders. So, the challenge is narrowing that down in a way that allows us to identify ways to either prevent or treat the disease. 

This is what my research was focused on before I started graduate school, and while I was working as a research technician in Dr. Helen Scharfman’s lab. There, I was using a mouse model of AD to study the role of hyperexcitability and the effects of a putative treatment. In this model, mice have a genetic mutation that leads to biological and behavioral phenotypes that resemble those found in humans with AD. These include Αβ plaque formation, memory loss, hyperexcitability etc. 

The putative treatment we were studying was perinatal (shortly before and after birth) choline supplementation. To administer the treatment, I would give pregnant dams a diet rich in choline. Then I would look at AD pathology in their pups. **What we found was that supplementation of the maternal diet with choline was surprisingly effective in reducing some of the AD symptoms in the pups**. 

This is an important finding that contributes to a growing body of research supporting the benefits of perinatal choline supplementation. However, we have a long way to go before we can translate this to clinical practice.  

## 🌯 Wrap-Up

Therefore, thanks to Liza’s novel research—which is continuously expanding our understanding of this enigmatic disease—we can safely say exploring hyperexcitability is one of the many promising paths in our fight against AD!
