📠 A place to log and display progress for the development of MoodFlip for IOS! It’s built by leveraging toolkits and APIs from [Hume](https://hume.ai/) & [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). Enabling you to be actionable with your emotions—just choose what to sustain or remedy!

**Even the CEO of Hume AI liked the idea!**

## 👓 Envisioning the Vision

I hope to provide meaningful advice to the user based on what they want to foster. I am particularly interested in incorporating strategies identified in neurology and psychology to reduce feelings of dehumanization into an AI model. **In other words, mental health is difficult (especially for young people); selfies aren't too bad, so I'm combining the two to make it easier for everyone involved!**

> “Children who spent more than three hours using social networking websites on a school day were twice as likely to report high or very high scores for mental ill-health.”

## 🌐 Building the Prototype

Prior to getting started on a full-fledged mobile app, I had to create a proof of concept with *the usual suspects: Python, CSS, JavaScript, and HTML*. However, although it was relatively easy to iterate and build, I knew an idea of this kind would never work on a website. Regardless, without going through this step, I would have never come up with clever solutions to complex issues that were sure to arise.

[As you can see, even an early demo built on a technology that is not intended for release can be very helpful in ironing out key details! Especially if you are using a more easy to use and iterative stack.](https://youtube.com/shorts/3u4a3eJP1Qc?feature=share)

## 📱 Mobilizing the Idea

Here’s a sneak peak into what the Swift based app could look like—ever closer to a usable mood companion. I’ve tried my best to create a UI/UX that is loosely based off of modern social media apps like Snapchat and BeReal. Making it a familiar yet refreshing experience.

## 🔮 What’s Next?

I'm eager to make the most of this project and present it elsewhere after its flushed out and backed by real data (I hope to implement it at my local homeless shelter).
