As a design lead for SMathHacks, the North Carolina School of Science and Math’s (NCSSM) hackathon, I was responsible for creating several creative pieces in tandem with the logo. The entire process required me to coordinate with a statewide team of students and advisors, as well as vendors—taking several months.

## 🧠 Initial Thoughts

To get to be a designer in the first place, I was tasked with creating a proposal that included my ideas for the hackathon. I found several preexisting designs as reference for building a design language for the rest of the project. From the start, I knew I wanted to create something sleek and modern but with a touch of craftiness to fit the scrappy and largely student focused audience. Plus, it was serious; 150+ hackers and $45k in funding were at stake.

## 🔁 Iterate. Iterate. Iterate.

After getting the position and talking to the team, I came to realize just how broad the scope was. As a result, I immediately began iterating; as evidenced by the “astro” elements, I was aiming to create a design language that embodied the space focused nature of the hackathon. 

To me, both the star and lunar motifs were practically necessary to include; creatively employing the aforementioned elements proved to be nothing short of aiming for the stars. Not to mention, I had to grapple with and include the perspectives of other students, including a designer focused on the website and presentations, and faculty across the state.

## ⭐ The North Star

After a few weeks, the team and I realized that we needed to finalize on a “north star,” or a guiding principle, for the entirety of the design language. Therefore, finalizing on the logo became the top priority for me.

Apart from the “spacey” symbolism, I employed a custom bubble-like, rounded typeface through a mix of Illustrator and Figma. This gave the logo a friendly and playful tone, resonating with youth and creativity.

## 🎨 The Design Language

Here’s a handful of the many things we had to create. As the designer, I focused on creating an almost seamless integration of the banners and other design elements to create a cohesive look—almost as if the designs are part of an endless universe.

## 📷 Capturing the Moment

In addition to designing, I was intrigued by photographing the Durham portion (the event was ran at Morganton, Durham, and Online) of the hackathon. Here are some of the shots I got over the two day period; it was really awesome to see everyone in person, enjoying hacking and all the food we had!. Also, it was extremely rewarding to get compliments about the design.

During the day, we also helped setup the banners and such; my favorite was definitely taking a bit of the highly acclaimed Monuts from down the street (which we lugged in a cart down to NCSSM).
