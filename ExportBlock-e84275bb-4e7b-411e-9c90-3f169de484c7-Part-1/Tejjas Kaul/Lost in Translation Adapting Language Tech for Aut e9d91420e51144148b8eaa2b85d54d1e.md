📠 Here’s a conversation I had with [Oscar Moreno-Lizarazo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oscar-moreno-lizarazo/), an upcoming MD candidate @ Harvard, after I reached out to him on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tejjas-kaul-36091a22b/). We discussed his and his team’s work with the PANDABox at UNC Chapel Hill—enabling them to bridge the gap between Spanish-Speakers and proactive Autism healthcare.

🛑 **Before we get going, it’s important to acknowledge the lack of awareness and stigma in Hispanic communities surrounding Autism (ASD). Let’s look at an analogous study for some background:** 

> “Many Latino families in the study had not heard of ASD or had little information about it. Families sometimes assumed ASD red flags were normal or could be attributed to family dysfunction. Families also had concerns about provider communication and access to language services. Having a child with a developmental delay was associated with embarrassment, rejection, and family burden, making it difficult for parents to raise developmental concerns with providers…
> 

> Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) affect up to 1 in 68 U.S. children over the age of three, and early ASD identification has been linked to improved long-term developmental and family coping outcomes. However, racial/ethnic disparities in ASD diagnosis continue to be problematic. Latino children are diagnosed with an ASD 2.5 years later than white non-Latino children, and are more often missed in diagnosis despite meeting ASD diagnostic criteria.”

## 💯 How Does it Score?

***I would love to get to know more about your work surrounding Hispanic parents' experiences with Purdue's PANDABox. From what I could put together, it's an impressive piece of kit that has become a trusted avenue in the early detection of Autism thanks to its relative economic feasibility coupled with an advanced tele-health first feature-set. However, through your extensive research and time with it, did you find its Spanish capabilities to be seemingly subpar to its English counterpart? Or were they as capable as one another, and in turn, both suitable methods to further lessen the load off of in-person testing methods in their respective communities?***

*This is a great question that ultimately is our research's goal! While we were able to translate the PANDABox into Spanish through our work, we gathered a lot of obstacles from interviewing the participants in our study. Some of them are very logistical. For example, Spanish is such a diverse language that some participants were unfamiliar with some of the names of the activities we asked them to perform with their children. The game "Peek a boo" was an activity that, depending on the nationality and American assimilation of the Spanish-speaking subject, could create confusion for participants. Others are more cultural. We found that some participants were very concerned with the confidentiality of their immigration status when participating in remote studies. Both of these obstacles apply to Spanish-speaking/immigrant populations but not those that are Caucasian American. I think these issues could hinder some of the capabilities of the Spanish version of the PANDABox.*

*In terms of validity between existing Spanish-speaking remote assessments for autism and our Spanish version of the PANDABox, that is the future direction of our research. Our current work, and upcoming manuscript, focused more on the qualitative experiences of participants. Overall, we found that Spanish-speaking families enjoyed speaking directly to a Spanish-speaking provider instead of an interpreter, participating directly in the autism assessment, felt the technology was easy to use, and captured their child's natural behaviors. These findings support that this technology could be helpful for Spanish-speaking populations, which may face cultural obstacles such as fear of navigating the healthcare system or a lack of transportation.*

## 🌐 Cultural Barriers

***Furthermore, I’m from India and have consequently been exposed to multiple languages (Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, etc.) from a young age. I’ve had to become accustomed to the slang terms and norms of American English—nearly a whole new language from the Indianized English I had grown up with. So naturally, I am curious about the localization capabilities of this platform and whether or not it can be implemented elsewhere. Especially for cultures and languages vastly different from western ones.***

*This is also a great question. Similarly to your experiences, Spanish is a very diverse language in terms of colloquial terms used between nations. One of the advantages of the PANDABox is that slang terms or activities can be easily edited and updated. This advantage was something that I saw in real time as I participated in the research.*

*As part of our research, we had to interview participants on the language used in the PANDABox and if there were any difficulties they experienced understanding the material. While they had no issues for the most part, there were specific terms they may not have understood. Thus, our team met weekly to discuss these discrepancies and create edits to the PANDABox materials to make them more easily understandable. This editing could have included swapping out terms or creating additional explanations for specific activities of the PANDABox. Thus, I believe PANDABox can be used in languages with linguistic diversity. Of course, this would require that the team handling the exam administration is familiar with the culture and language of the participants.*

🗺️ The challenge of serving minorities is not limited to the United States. In fact, geographical areas with diverse cultures and languages (e.g. India as shown in [the map above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_India#/media/File:Indian_Languages_Map.jpg)) make it difficult to develop and provide unified healthcare—especially when certain communities are less privileged than others.

## 🤿 Deep Dive

***Additionally, It would be great for you to give the nitty gritty of the whole lab process (as much as you deem fit of course) and maybe even what led you to pursue this research in the first place. Also, do you feel that this sort of testing with capable proprietary software is the future? Or should researchers pursue standalone app development—although it may not be as effective—as it will be easier to get into more and more disprivileged households?***

*Of course. We started with the English version of the PANDABox and then translated the materials from English to Spanish. When we had the “final” version of the PANDABox materials, we used this assessment on our participants. However, we continued to update the materials as we saw fit whenever confusion arose about specific phrases or words.*

*The participants in the study consisted of Spanish-speaking families with infants who were deemed at high-risk for autism. While they completed the PANDABox assessment, they also completed other validation measures to provide more formal recommendations for children who may have autism. As part of our study, we also interviewed the family participant (who was always the mother) to understand better how they felt using the Spanish PANDABox. I and another lab member, analyzed this interview data to identify common themes that came up and report them.*

*In terms of what made me pursue this research, I have always had a passion for promoting equity through medicine. At its core, this made me interested in becoming a physician. In the post-COVID world, tele-health has increased exponentially, and medicine is finding new ways to increase access to healthcare by using this technology. To demonstrate how much the world of medicine has changed during the first three months of the 2020 pandemic, [one national study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9035352/#:~:text=A%20national%20study%20including%2036,interactions%20in%20the%20same%20period) found that telemedicine encounters increased by nearly 800%! When I came across Dr. Kinard’s research project as a Junior in undergrad, I was excited about learning more about how technology could be used to promote healthcare equity in the United States, especially given that tele-health had experienced such a boom in the past three years. Thus, I decided to apply to become a research assistant and participate in the project. After participating in this work, I am looking to find other ways to implement remote technology to increase healthcare assess during my medical career. For example, some organizations merge remote radiological services and global health to promote healthcare access in different countries.*

*I do think that it is the future. We are only tapping into the surface of what tele-health can achieve. One of the biggest pros our participants found in participating in the PANDABox was the ability to speak with a Spanish-speaking healthcare provider as they completed their assessment. This advantage is possible through remote technology that closes distance barriers. While app development is also a great way to increase healthcare access and should be pursued in parallel with tele-health technology, I fear this platform would take away from the patient-provider interaction that tele-health can provide. In regards to treating minority populations, speaking with providers who come from similar backgrounds is incredibly important to improve healthcare outcomes, and a plethora of research articles has supported this. In terms of the ability of app development to get inside more underprivileged households, this may or may not be the case! Our participants were socioeconomically diverse, and we had no issue getting the materials to them or receiving them. Moreover, we used more or less the same materials with each family and even provided them with an internet hotspot if they did not have WIFI. Notably, the former point allows institutions to drive costs down, which may have been passed down to the patient undergoing the assessment. However, the actual cost and insurance coverage of a Spanish version of the PANDABox is something that we will know once this assessment gets formally approved.*

This graph from the aforementioned study displays the boom in America’s telehealth sector due to the pandemic. Cementing the importance of both the field and the need to level the playing field.

## 📱/🏥 Virtual or In-person?

***Lastly, do you reckon that tele-health tech like the PANDABox and other novel virtual methodologies that have taken off since the global pandemic are going to overtake conventional testing? Or should a more holistic approach that employs a multitude of remote and on-site techniques be taken? Especially given the fact that computerized methods lack the organicness of the human touch—a notion noted in the mixed conclusion.***

*Overall, both testing methods should be used independently and with the patient's consent. Per your point, some participants preferred conventional testing to remote testing. One reason is that they do not trust remote technology to replace a traditional in-person visit. Thus, participants who are uncomfortable with remote technology should have the option to participate in conventional testing. On the other hand, families with obstacles, such as transportation issues, should be allowed to participate in remote testing as long as it is a valid method of diagnosing autism. Of course, families who participate in remote testing should be fully informed of any potential limitations of this technology and associated risks.*

*In terms of using both remote and in-person services together, I do not currently see the need to do such a thing since both methods lead to the same conclusion, just in different ways. It is more of a question of making sure that the patient is comfortable with the testing method they will undergo. Some participants enjoyed being in the comfort of their homes to complete the testing. Others felt it would be better if they could be inside a clinic. The patient's wishes should always be respected; that should be how we follow through with a treatment plan. This principle is not specific to remote technology but a pillar of medicine (patient autonomy) that should always be adhered to.*

## 🌯 Wrap-Up

The sheer lack of awareness and stigma surrounding autism in Hispanic communities coupled with the disparities in diagnosis for Latino children is concerning. In essence, Oscar’s work makes it clear that the PANDABox is a step in the right direction to remedy that.
